# AutoHydrate

## Overview
AutoHydrate is an intelligent, automated irrigation system designed to optimize water usage and ensure efficient hydration for plants. It uses real-time soil moisture monitoring and weather conditions to control water flow, reducing wastage and improving plant health.

## Features
- **Automated Watering:** Uses soil moisture sensors to determine optimal watering schedules.
- **Weather Integration:** Adjusts irrigation based on weather forecasts.
- **Remote Monitoring:** IoT-enabled system for real-time tracking.
- **Energy Efficient:** Low power consumption with optimized pump control.
- **Customizable Settings:** User-configurable parameters for different plant types.

## Components Used
- **Sensors:** Soil Moisture Sensor, Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- **Microcontroller:** Arduino/Raspberry Pi
- **Actuators:** Water Pump, Solenoid Valves
- **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for remote access
- **Power Supply:** Rechargeable Battery/Solar Panel (optional)

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** Sensors continuously monitor soil moisture levels.
2. **Decision Making:** Based on predefined thresholds and weather data, the system determines watering needs.
3. **Activation:** If necessary, the pump is activated to irrigate the plants.
4. **Monitoring & Feedback:** Real-time data is sent to the user via a mobile or web dashboard.

## Installation
1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Connect sensors to the microcontroller.
   - Attach the water pump and valves.
   - Ensure a stable power supply.

2. **Software Installation:**
   - Install necessary dependencies (Arduino IDE, Python, etc.).
   - Upload the code to the microcontroller.
   - Configure Wi-Fi settings for remote monitoring.

## Usage
- Set threshold moisture levels via the dashboard.
- Monitor real-time data and system status.
- Manually override automatic watering if needed.

## Future Improvements
- AI-based predictive analytics for better irrigation control.
- Integration with a mobile app.
- Solar-powered version for enhanced sustainability.
